# Porting Hollow to .NET 10

This directory holds a .NET 10 port of Netflix Hollow's core engine. It is a work in progress. The
memory, encoding and schema layers are complete; on top of them, `OBJECT` types round-trip end to end
— a `HollowWriteStateEngine` writes a snapshot blob that a `HollowReadStateEngine` reads back, with
every field type, nulls, sharding, field filtering and cross-cycle ordinal reuse covered by tests.
List, set and map types are not written or read yet. The status section says exactly what is and is
not here.

## Building and testing

```
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

Requires the .NET 10 SDK. On a machine without ICU installed, set
`DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=1` — nothing in the port depends on culture-sensitive
behaviour.

## Layout

| Java | .NET |
| --- | --- |
| `hollow/src/main/java/com/netflix/hollow/...` | `dotnet/src/Hollow/...` |
| `hollow/src/test/java/com/netflix/hollow/...` | `dotnet/tests/Hollow.Tests/...` |
| package `com.netflix.hollow.core.memory.encoding` | namespace `Hollow.Core.Memory.Encoding` |
| package `com.netflix.hollow.api.error` | namespace `Hollow.Api.Error` |

Java packages map to .NET namespaces one for one with the `com.netflix` prefix dropped and each
segment PascalCased. Java's one-public-type-per-file rule is not followed where a type is trivially
small and only meaningful alongside its neighbour (for example the iterator interfaces and their empty
implementations share a file).

## Naming changes

Where a Java name could not be carried over, the reason is recorded in a `<remarks>` block on the .NET
type. The systematic changes are:

- **Interfaces take an `I` prefix.** `ByteData` → `IByteData`, `FixedLengthData` → `IFixedLengthData`,
  `VariableLengthData` → `IVariableLengthData`, `ArraySegmentRecycler` → `IArraySegmentRecycler`,
  `HollowDataset` → `IHollowDataset`, `TypeFilter` → `ITypeFilter`, `HollowOrdinalIterator` →
  `IHollowOrdinalIterator`, `HollowTypeStateListener` → `IHollowTypeStateListener`, and the
  `Hollow*TypeDataAccess` family.
- **Getters and setters become properties.** `getName()` → `Name`, `numFields()` → `FieldCount`,
  `setElementTypeState(x)`/`getElementTypeState()` → `ElementTypeState { get; set; }`.
- **`HashCodes.hashCode(...)` → `HashCodes.Compute(...)`**, because a static method named after
  `object.GetHashCode` reads as an override, and `HashCode` is an unrelated BCL type. The hash values
  are unchanged — they are part of the blob layout contract.
- **Enums with per-constant data become plain enums plus an extensions class.** C# enums cannot carry
  fields, so `HollowObjectSchema.FieldType` is the top-level `FieldType` enum with
  `FieldTypeExtensions`, and `HollowSchema.SchemaType` is `SchemaType` with `SchemaTypeExtensions`.
  `FieldType` members are PascalCase (`FieldType.Int`), so `ToWireName()` maps them back to the
  upper-case names the blob format uses.
- **Default interface methods that are pure helpers become extension methods.** A C# default interface
  member is only callable through the interface, which would force a cast at most call sites, so
  `ByteData.readLongBits` → `ByteDataExtensions.ReadInt64Bits` and `HollowDataset.hasIdenticalSchemas`
  → `HollowDatasetExtensions.HasIdenticalSchemas`. Members that implementations override
  (`ITypeFilter.Resolve`) stay on the interface.
- **`getFilePointer()` → `Position`**, since the .NET abstraction is a stream rather than a file.
- **`SegmentedByteArray.copy(long, byte[], int, int)` → `CopyTo`**, to make the direction explicit
  where Java relies on parameter order.

## Behavioural differences

### The fixed-length bit string no longer uses unaligned reads

Java's `FixedLengthElementArray` reads elements with `sun.misc.Unsafe`, loading eight bytes at an
unaligned byte offset inside a `long[]`. That is fast, but it is little-endian-only, it reads past the
end of a segment (which is why Java allocates one extra `long` per segment and duplicates the next
segment's first word into it — the "fencepost"), and it silently corrupts element values wider than 58
bits at unlucky bit offsets. Java's own tests for that corruption are commented out in the source.

This port composes each element from the one or two 64-bit words that actually contain it. The
consequences:

- No fencepost slot is allocated or maintained, so `IArraySegmentRecycler.GetLongArray()` returns
  exactly `1 << Log2OfLongSegmentSize` elements rather than one more.
- `GetElementValue` and `GetLargeElementValue` are now equivalent. Both are kept so ported call sites
  read like the original.
- Element widths up to 64 bits are correct at every offset. `FixedLengthElementArrayTests` pins this.
- Reads that straddle a word boundary cost an extra shift and or.

The serialised form is unchanged: it is, and always was, a count followed by that many big-endian
64-bit words.

### `setNull` on a variable-length field

Java's `HollowObjectWriteRecord.setNull` marks the field *present* and writes a null marker into its
buffer. For fixed-length fields that is equivalent to leaving the field unset, but for `STRING` and
`BYTES` the field is then serialised with a length prefix in front of the marker, so it reads back as
a one-byte value rather than as null. This port marks the field absent instead: byte-identical to
Java for every fixed-length type, and correct for the variable-length ones.
`RoundTripTests.ExplicitlyNulledStringReadsBackAsNull` pins it.

### NaN bit patterns

`HollowObjectWriteRecord` derives its float and double null sentinels from Java's canonical NaN
(`0x7FC00000` / `0x7FF8000000000000`) plus one. .NET's `float.NaN` and `double.NaN` have the sign bit
set, so deriving the sentinel the way Java does would produce a different, incompatible value. The
sentinels are written as literals, and a NaN *value* is canonicalised to Java's pattern before being
stored, matching `Float.floatToIntBits` rather than `floatToRawIntBits`.

### Concurrency primitives

Java's `AtomicLongArray` has no .NET equivalent. `ThreadSafeBitSet` and `ByteArrayOrdinalMap` use
`long[]` with `Volatile` and `Interlocked` operations instead, which give the same publication
guarantees.

`SegmentedByteArray.orderedCopy` issues one release fence for the whole block rather than Java's
`Unsafe.putByteVolatile` per byte. This is sufficient: a record is only ever published by writing its
ordinal after its bytes, so one fence before that publication orders all of it.

### Empty arrays

`SegmentedLongArray` computes its segment count as `((numLongs - 1) >>> log2) + 1`, which underflows
into a nonsensical count when `numLongs` is zero. The port allocates one segment in that case, so a
type present in the schema with no records works.

### Logging

The port takes no logging dependency. Where Java logs, the port either throws or raises an event —
`ByteArrayOrdinalMap.SoftLimitBreached` is the one instance so far.

### Java-compatible binary IO

`HollowBlobInput` and `HollowBlobOutput` reproduce `java.io.DataInput`/`DataOutput`: big-endian
integers and modified UTF-8 strings (`ModifiedUtf8`). This has no BCL equivalent —
`BinaryReader.ReadString` uses a 7-bit-encoded length and standard UTF-8 — and is required for a .NET
consumer to read a blob a Java producer wrote. `BlobIoTests` pins the byte sequences.

Java's `HollowBlobInput` abstracts over `DataInputStream` and `RandomAccessFile` to serve its two
memory modes; .NET's `Stream` covers both, so the port wraps a stream and reports seekability through
`CanSeek`.

## Status

### Ported and tested

| Java package | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `core.memory` | `IByteData`, `ArrayByteData`, `ByteDataArray`, `SegmentedByteArray`, `SegmentedLongArray`, `ByteArrayOrdinalMap`, `FreeOrdinalTracker`, `ThreadSafeBitSet`, `IFixedLengthData`, `IVariableLengthData`, `MemoryMode` |
| `core.memory.encoding` | `ZigZag`, `VarInt`, `HashCodes`, `FixedLengthElementArray` |
| `core.memory.pool` | `IArraySegmentRecycler`, `WastefulRecycler`, `RecyclingRecycler` |
| `core.schema` | `HollowSchema` and the object/list/set/map schemas, `FieldType`, `SchemaType`, `SimpleHollowDataset` |
| `core.index.key` | `PrimaryKey` (identity and accessors only) |
| `core` | `HollowConstants`, `IHollowDataset` |
| `core.util` | `BitSet` (a port-specific stand-in for `java.util.BitSet`) |
| `core.write` | `IHollowWriteRecord`, `HollowObjectWriteRecord`, `FieldStatistics`, `HollowTypeWriteState`, `HollowObjectTypeWriteState`, `HollowWriteStateEngine`, `HollowBlobHeaderWriter`, `HollowBlobWriter`, `HollowBlobOutput` |
| `core.read` | `HollowBlobInput`, `HollowBlobHeaderReader`, `HollowBlobReader`, `HollowReadStateEngine`, `HollowTypeReadState`, `PopulatedOrdinalListener`, `SnapshotPopulatedOrdinalsReader`, the data-access interfaces, `ITypeFilter` |
| `core.read.engine.object` | `HollowObjectTypeDataElements`, `HollowObjectTypeReadState` |

Test coverage is carried over from the Java tests where they exist — `VarIntTest`, `HashCodesTest`,
`FixedLengthElementArrayTest`, `FreeOrdinalTrackerTest`, `ThreadSafeBitSetTest`,
`ByteArrayOrdinalTest`, and the schema tests — with additional cases for the port-specific IO layer.
`HashCodesTests` pins MurmurHash3 output against values produced by an independent transcription of
the Java algorithm, so the port cannot drift from the blob layout contract unnoticed.

`RoundTripTests` covers the write and read engines together, which is the only way to check the blob
format itself: the bit packing, the variable-length ranges, the null sentinels, the shard layout and
the trailing populated-ordinals bit set all have to agree for a record to survive the trip.

### Ported, not yet covered by a round-trip

`HollowObjectSchema.FilterSchema` and the read path honour a filter, but only the explicit include
sets of `TypeFilter` exist; the recursive rule DSL is still absent.

### Not ported

- **List, set and map types.** Only `OBJECT` types are written and read. `HollowListTypeWriteState`,
  `HollowSetTypeWriteState`, `HollowMapTypeWriteState` and their read-side counterparts
  (`Hollow*TypeReadState`, `Hollow*TypeDataElements`, the ordinal iterators' concrete
  implementations, `SetMapKeyHasher`) are the largest remaining gap. `HollowBlobReader` throws a
  clear `NotSupportedException` when it meets one rather than misreading the blob.
- **Deltas.** Delta and reverse-delta production and application, `GapEncodedVariableLengthIntegerReader`,
  and historical state creation. `HollowTypeWriteState` keeps the previous cycle's populated ordinals,
  so the bookkeeping a delta needs is present; the encoders are not.
- **Restore and resharding.** Restoring a write state from a read state, and changing a type's shard
  count across cycles. A type's shard count is fixed when it is first written.
- **Partitioned ordinal maps.** `HollowTypeWriteState` uses a single `ByteArrayOrdinalMap`, which is
  Java's default; the four-way partitioned variant is not ported.
- **Shared-memory mode.** `MemoryMode.SharedMemoryLazy` and the `BlobByteBuffer`, `EncodedByteBuffer`
  and `EncodedLongBuffer` types behind it. Constructing a read state engine with it throws.
- **Object mapper.** `core.write.objectmapper` — mapping POCOs to Hollow records, and the
  `HollowPrimaryKey`/`HollowInline`/`HollowTypeName` attributes. Records are built field by field
  through `HollowObjectWriteRecord` for now.
- **Optional blob parts**, which split a snapshot across several streams.
- **Indexing** (`core.index` beyond `PrimaryKey`), **tools** (`core.tools`: diff, history, combine,
  split, patch, checksum), **the producer and consumer APIs** (`api.producer`, `api.consumer`),
  **code generation** (`api.codegen`), **sampling** (`api.sampling`), and every module outside
  `hollow` — `hollow-diff-ui`, `hollow-explorer-ui`, `hollow-jsonadapter`, `hollow-protoadapter`,
  `hollow-zenoadapter`, `hollow-test`, `hollow-fakedata`.
- **`GarbageCollectorAwareRecycler`**, which picks a pooling strategy by inspecting the JVM's
  collector through `ManagementFactory`. The decision it encodes does not transfer to .NET; pick
  `RecyclingRecycler` or `WastefulRecycler` explicitly.

### Suggested order for the remaining work

1. The list, set and map type states, write side and read side together so each can be round-tripped
   as it lands. They follow the same shape as the object type: measure, pack, write shard by shard;
   read shard by shard, decode on demand.
2. The object mapper, so callers can hand over POCOs instead of building records field by field.
3. Deltas, which need `GapEncodedVariableLengthIntegerReader` first.
4. Resharding and restore, which build on deltas.
